       " \"My experience with Tesla has been nothing short of a complete disaster. I have never had such a horrible experience with purchasing anything ever. The quality of the vehicle itself is definitely not what a brand new $150,000 vehicle should be, or anywhere close. The customer service is so horrible that it's beginning to be comical. They say they'll call back, and never do. I've been told I'd get a call back or that the situation would be taken care of \\xa010+ times now and I NEVER get a call, email, txt, notification, nothing. Delivery was an absolute disaster, they canceled on me 4 times last minute after I had moved my schedule around to make sure I was there for the drop off. It's like they assume that I have nothing else to do other than sit around and wait for them. Finally when they delivered the car, they were in a hurry and didn't even give me a chance to walk the vehicle or go over anything. The next day I had a chance to lol I've things. LOL! Where do I start.-the car pulls HARD to the right.-the drivers side front port window has a gash in it. -the trim under the right window has a dent in it. -the paint, lol, I may as well have painted it myself. Over spray and crap everywhere. -the driver side window has a mind of its own. -so does the charge port door, opens and closes when it wants. -auto pilot cut someone off and almost cause an accident the fist time I used it. Phantom braking happens all the time. ...That's all I can think of at the moment. So I called in. And I called in. Aaaaand I called in. Finally after the 5th or 6th person and about 3-4 hrs, I got through to someone who set up an appointment. You guessed it! They canceled it last minute. Of course right. And schedule it out for a month later! So I called, and I called, and I called, aaaand I called. After hours on the phone again, I got through to a manager who said that they'd get it taken care of and call me back. Welp, now its been just a week and to my surprise, I haven't received any type of communication from anyone.Moral of the story, don't buy a Tesla.\",\n",
       " \"This is for our amazing experience with the service center. \\xa0They went above and beyond for us and it was the best repair experience we've ever had with any car.We had a warranty repair on our Model Y that was going to take a long time to complete. \\xa0The shop was incredibly understanding and helpful about our kids and car seats and worked with us to plan ahead. \\xa0When the day came they fixed a major issue for us 40% faster than expected, and they fixed a minor issue even though we didn't think the parts were in stock! \\xa0Finally, they were ultra flexible with us on pickup. \\xa0THANK YOU!\",\n",
       " 'Kevin and Bridget were amazing. I purchased a used Tesla abs picked it up in Rocklin. That experience was horrible and made me second guess my purchase. Kevin gave me a real live tutorial, showed me how everything works and answered all the questions about all the features in my model 3 long range. They redeemed my confidence in this company and am truly grateful for the time they took with me. Bridget was very apologetic and told me she would follow up on the poor experience I received in Rocklin. Please reward and acknowledge Kevin and Bridget for being the best way to build trust and confidence in the Tesla company and product. I will definitely go back to them if I have any other questions.',\n",

       " 'I am appalled by the poor service at this Tesla location. \\xa0First, you cannot speak to anyone in Service directly - when you call, you are sent to an automated message that directs you to an app (and you can then only correspond via messaging in the app, with often multiple days delay). \\xa0Today, I called in to the sales department - the only way to get a live person on the phone - and I explained that the door to my brand new model X would not open. He refused to help me with my request, simply saying, \"I need to wait to hear back.\" \\xa0And then when I asked to speak to a manager, he hung up on me! \\xa0Completely unacceptable level of service, especially given the price tag of these automobiles.',\n",

       " \"I ended up filing a complaint against them with the California Bureau of Automotive Repair for not refunding me for replacement parts that weren't actually required to repair my car and didn't fix my issues.Sigh. Tesla keeps letting me down with post-warranty support.Time for a new car anyway-- It's not gonna be a Tesla.\",\n",
       " \"Typically I go to the Tesla Berkeley service center, but I needed a faster appointment window. Also, I was curious to see the SF location. So I booked the appointment through the proprietary Tesla app and the day of appointment, arrived exactly at 8:45am. I was greeted promptly and told to wait for my service advisor, Melissa. A few minutes went by and Melissa approached my vehicle to review the reported issues. In addition to a brake fluid flush and wheel alignment adjustment, I also reported a clicking noise behind the dashboard. Melissa understood the issues reported and was able to add my notes for the technicians. She notified me that I would receive Uber credit to use for the afternoon. While the credits took about an hour (understandable due to their work load), I did receive up to $100 in available Uber credit. Throughout the afternoon there was communication through the app and I was notified the vehicle would be complete between 4:15pm and 4:45pm. I arrived back at the service center at 4:15pm and the job WAS completed by 4:45pm. Melissa went over the work completed, and was honest about the time spent on my car. The final cost was less than the initial estimate and she was able to goodwill some of the costs. Overall, I'm satisfied with the experience and outcome. Thanks Melissa and Tesla SF team!\"]"
